Hi everyone,

As some of you already know, I am leaving Delightex on the 31st of August.

It’s been a tough decision for me to make --- not least because working at Delightex has been an incredible privilege.
You taught me a lot and helped me grow professionally, while also being great friends, nice pals to chat, jog and ride a
bicycle with. For all of this, I am overwhelmingly grateful.

I guess I’ve been too demanding to some of you at times, maybe caring about little things way too much. Please don't
take it personally and rest assured no offense was intended; if it helps, I truly think these were wonderful eight and a
half years of my life and I wouldn’t be able to say this if each and every one of you wasn’t a part of it. I thank you
all for the honor of working together, and I am very proud of what we have achieved.

I would like to take a moment and thank personally my fellow engineers. I doubt I will ever work with such a talented
team --- so high is the bar you’ve set. I wish you good luck. Please forgive me for leaving behind a bunch of bugs for
you to fix :slightly_smiling_face:

That's it!
