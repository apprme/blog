As some of you already know, I am leaving Delightex on the 31st of August.
Itâ€™s been a tough decision for me to make &amp;mdash; not least because working at Delightex has been an incredible privilege. You taught me a lot and helped me grow professionally, while also being great friends, nice pals to chat, jog and ride a bicycle with. For all of this, I am overwhelmingly grateful.</description></item></channel></rss>
